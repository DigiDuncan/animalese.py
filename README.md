## What is Animalese (etc.)?
**Animalese** is *Animal Crossing*'s "language" the characters speak in. What it actually is, however, is the individual letters of the words basically said aloud and ran into each other at various pitches and speeds.

**Bebebese** is another language found in *Animal Crossing*, but instead of approximating phonemes by running letter sounds together, it is comprised of various beeps.
